##Style information

The style file has been built using ArcGIS for Desktop 10.1 and includes all the style information needed to display OSM data within the ArcGIS software in the style of the humanitarian theme.

The stylesheet contains the symbols for the points, lines and polygons to be displayed, as well as the styles for labelling. There are currently no labels included in the template layers, however these styles will enable the creation of labels for individual projects in the style of OSM.

Further style updates will be added as the project progresses. Icons will be added to the style file for attributes not currently displayed on the humanitarian OSM.

The styles are designed based on the [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) humanitarian theme. The original style information can be found at [HDM-CartoCSS](https://github.com/hotosm/HDM-CartoCSS) and is derived from [CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto).
